              I have been taking piano lessons since 2011, and since then it has become an integral part of my life, staying with me through different cities and different schools. I achieved first class honors on my level 10 practical. Piano, to me, is an outlet of expression and creativity made possible through dedication to practicing and improvement. I have also completed all of ARCT theory, notably achieving first class honors in both history and analysis. </br></br> Additionally, I am a teacher of low cost lessons offered by the non profit organization From Art to Heart. I teach weekly lessons, preparing and organizing material for lessons each week. This program provides beginner lessons to a predominantly younger demographic. Apart from the literal responsibilities of providing and preparing these lessons, I have also learned to become more adaptable in my communication while working with children; half rests may be better understood by children as a tophat compared to the literal symbol and definition.

              I am a director for the Community Music Performances Program at From Art to Heart, which aims to provide performance opportunities to talented youth and also inject enthusiasm through recitals for seniorsâ€”who have been and still are particularly isolated because of pandemic regulations. I organize and plan with other members of the team, and outreach to potential performance locations.

              Member of school's debate club for 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 season. Debate club holds weekly meetings with practice rounds, which takes roughly 1.5 hours for every meeting. I have recently participated in the Churchill debate tournament, placing 4th as a team and 8th speaker overall. Participating in debate as an activity has allowed me to grow and develop as a speaker; I find greater confidence and comfort, notably in impromptu or unrehearsed presentations.

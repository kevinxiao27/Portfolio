          <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="v-pills-piano" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-piano-tab" tabindex="0">I have been taking piano lessons since 2011, and since then it has become an integral part of my life, staying with me through different cities and different schools. I achieved first class honors on my level 10 practical. Piano, to me, is an outlet of expression and creativity made possible through dedication to practicing and improvement. I have also completed all of ARCT theory, notably achieving first class honors in both history and analysis. </br></br> Additionally, I am a teacher of low cost lessons offered by the non profit organization From Art to Heart. I teach weekly lessons, preparing and organizing material for lessons each week. This program provides beginner lessons to a predominantly younger demographic. Apart from the literal responsibilities of providing and preparing these lessons, I have also learned to become more adaptable in my communication while working with children; half rests may be better understood by children as a tophat compared to the literal symbol and definition.</div>
          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-performances" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-performances-tab" tabindex="0">I am a director for the Community Music Performances Program at From Art to Heart, which aims to provide performance opportunities to talented youth and also inject enthusiasm through recitals for seniors—who have been and still are particularly isolated because of pandemic regulations. I organize and plan with other members of the team, and outreach to potential performance locations.</div>
          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-debate" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-debate-tab" tabindex="0">Member of school's debate club for 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 season. Debate club holds weekly meetings with practice rounds, which takes roughly 1.5 hours for every meeting. I have recently participated in the Churchill debate tournament, placing 4th as a team and 8th speaker overall. Participating in debate as an activity has allowed me to grow and develop as a speaker; I find greater confidence and comfort, notably in impromptu or unrehearsed presentations. </div>
          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-creative" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-creative-tab" tabindex="0">I am a founding member of my school's Creative Writing Club. I organize and direct with other founders to host workshops and competitions for different forms of creative writing. We have hosted murder mystery play writing competition, providing writing spaces and workshops on play-writing conventions. Currently hosting weekly workshops on flash fiction.</div>
          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-badminton" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-badminton-tab" tabindex="0">I have been taking badminton lessons with Clearone after COVID restrictions were lifted, currently being a part of the high performance group, with weekly lessons of 3 hours. Badminton entails practice of different individual skills like clears and fundamental footwork, and improving them has supplemented the development of discipline, but also confidence—becoming more familiar with matches and my own technique has allowed me to gain confidence in my own abilities.</div>
          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-tutoring" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-tutoring-tab" tabindex="0">I am a tutor under the Tutoring Table program at tutoring. I volunteer for 2 hours a week, interacting and teaching highschool students mathematical concepts and skills. This program has taught me about the process of both teaching and learning; in teaching youths about mathematics, it requires a balance between demonstration of how to apply mathematical concepts and ideas, and allowing the students to solve problems on their own in the process of developing understanding.</div>
          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-library" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-library-tab" tabindex="0">I was a volunteer under numerous programs for the Calgary Public Library, such as math quest or coding buddies. Through this volunteering I have been able to nurture the interests of children in subjects such as math and coding, specifically impacting kids in my local community.</div>
